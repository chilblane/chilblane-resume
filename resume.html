                            I'm a product designer and design technologist with
                            extensive experience in marketing websites and
                            conversion forms. I also focus on design systems and
                            branding, information architecture, and visual
                            design.

                            and static generators like Hugo and Jekyll. I do not
                            consider myself a programmer, but aim to ensure good
                            design translates into good code and a good user
                            experience for the end user.
